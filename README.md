#Portfolio Site

This is the first website I have ever done. This site consists of two parts: 
  - an introduction of myself (background, hobbies, skills)
  - a photo album to illustrate the exciting experience I had in Australia during Working Holiday

#Responsiveness

To acheive the responsiveness across different resolution (from mobile to desktop), I use the Bootstrap framework. 

#Photo Album with paginations

I use the jQuery to control the album and switch the photos. I use the buttom to click function removeClass and addClass.
